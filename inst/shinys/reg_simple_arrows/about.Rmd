In this app we study what happens if we try to minimize the sum of errors only, as opposed to the sum of *squared* errors. $a$ is the intercept, $b$ is the slope.

## Observe

* Try to find the true line!
* It's at $a=1.5,b=-0.5$
* Compare the sum of errors at the true line to the sum of errors when you set $b=-0.51$! Which error is smaller?
* How is the same comparison for sum of the absolute values of the errors? Any Better?
